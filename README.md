# ubuntu_lamp
Docker image with Ubuntu, Apache and PHP: jbiancot/ubuntu_lamp

A more complete Docker image containing:

* Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (xenial)
* Apache/2.4.18
* PHP 7.0.22

I have tried some Docker LAMP images but they fall short, in many cases they have just basic Apache/PHP packages and it is hard to extend, or they do not follow conventions, e.g: path are different, etc.
Then I have decided to tailor-made my own trying to follow as much the Ubuntu's LAMP stack.

Here the list of packages I have used on some LAMP projects and what I have started with:
